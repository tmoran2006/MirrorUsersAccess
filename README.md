# MirrorUsersAccess
Uses PowerShell to mirror the access of one AD user to another

You will first enter the users sAMAccountName that you want to aquire the list security groups for which they are a member.
Second, enter the sAMAccountName of the target user you'd like to add to the same security groups.

The sourceUsers security group access should now be mirrored to the targetUser.
